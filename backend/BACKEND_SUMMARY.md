## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Install uv package manager (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
source ~/.local/bin/env

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
cd backend
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# or .venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
uv sync
```

### 2. Test the Backend
```bash
# Run the comprehensive test suite
uv run test_backend.py
```

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
# Start the FastAPI development server
uv run main.py
```

### 4. Access the API
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Alternative Docs**: http://localhost:8000/redoc
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

## 📝 Database

The backend uses SQLite by default (file: `candlz_game.db`) but can be configured for PostgreSQL in production via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

On first startup, the backend automatically:
1. Creates all necessary database tables
2. Initializes default assets and achievements
3. Generates sample price history for demonstration

## 🔧 Configuration

Key settings can be configured via environment variables or by modifying `core/config.py`:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `MARKET_UPDATE_INTERVAL`: Price update frequency
- `DEFAULT_COMMISSION_RATE`: Trading commission (default: 0.1%)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Logging verbosity

## 🎯 Next Steps

The backend is now ready for frontend integration. You can:

1. **Build the Frontend**: Connect to the API endpoints to create the game UI
2. **Add Market Engine**: Implement real-time price updates and market simulation
3. **Algorithm System**: Add Python execution sandbox for trading algorithms
4. **Advanced Features**: Add more sophisticated market events, portfolio analytics, etc.

## 🤝 Frontend Integration

The backend provides everything needed for your frontend:

- **Authentication**: Player creation and management
- **Real-time Data**: Asset prices and market data
- **Trading**: Complete order management system
- **Portfolio**: Position tracking and performance analytics
- **Game Progression**: Achievements, levels, and wealth tiers

All endpoints return consistent JSON responses with proper error handling and validation.
