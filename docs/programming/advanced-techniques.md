## Machine Learning Integration

You can use Python's machine learning libraries (like scikit-learn) to build predictive models for trading. Example: train a classifier to predict price direction based on technical indicators, then use its output as a trading signal.

## Multi-Asset Strategies

Trade multiple assets simultaneously by looping through a list of assets in your `handle_data` function. Allocate capital based on risk or expected return.

## Custom Indicators

Define your own technical indicators using price and volume data. For example, create a custom volatility measure or a composite momentum score.

## Risk Management Automation

Implement stop-loss, take-profit, and position sizing rules directly in your algorithm. Use portfolio metrics (like max drawdown) to adjust risk dynamically.
