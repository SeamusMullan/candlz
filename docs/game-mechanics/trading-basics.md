# Trading Basics

Welcome to the exciting world of trading in candlz! This guide covers the fundamental concepts and mechanics that drive the game's economy.

## Core Trading Mechanics

### Buy Low, Sell High

The most basic trading strategy is simple: buy assets when their price is low and sell them when the price is higher. However, predicting these movements requires skill, analysis, and sometimes a bit of luck.

### Order Types

candlz offers several order types to give you flexibility in your trading:

- **Market Orders**: Execute immediately at the current market price
- **Limit Orders**: Set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell
- **Stop Orders**: Trigger a market order when price reaches a specified level
- **Stop-Limit Orders**: Combine stop and limit orders for more control

### Trading Fees

Every trade incurs a small fee to simulate real-world trading costs:

| Difficulty | Fee Percentage |
|------------|----------------|
| Casual     | 0.1%           |
| Standard   | 0.2%           |
| Hardcore   | 0.5%           |

Fees are calculated based on the total transaction value and deducted automatically from your account.

## Market Mechanics

## Risk Management

### Portfolio Diversification

- Commodities

### Leverage and Margin

As you progress, you'll unlock the ability to trade on margin, allowing you to borrow funds to increase your position size:

| Level | Maximum Leverage |
|-------|------------------|
| 1     | Not Available    |
| 5     | 2x               |
| 10    | 5x               |
| 20    | 10x              |

Warning: While leverage can multiply gains, it also multiplies losses!
